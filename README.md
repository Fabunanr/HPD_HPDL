# HPD_HPDL

This is a repository for a project to find shifts in evolutionary rates in the HPD and HPDL gene.

I performed an analysis using CODEML files for this analysis is included in this repository.

Files:
run_4model.sh - the bash script to run the anlysis on the UCR HPC
codeml.ctl - the control file needed for the analysis
Alignment_pal2nal_forcodeml.txt - the alignment file needed for the analysis
